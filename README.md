gdrivefoldermonitor
===================

Google Drive folder monitor with email alert

This code suits if you want to be emailed if a file is added to a folder from outside your domain. This can be easily edited to alert for filed added inside your domain also. Take a look at line 75.

Set the global variables to suit your own domain.

To monitor a folder go to 'file > project properties > project properties' and add row to include the folder id as property and empty array as value.
